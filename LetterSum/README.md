# LetterSum Task

This task is taken from :
`https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/onfehl/20210719_challenge_399_easy_letter_value_sum/`

## Task Aims
This task aims to give every letter in the alphabet a number 1 - 26 then to ask the user to input a string. After the user has input a string the program will calculate the total value of each character in the string. This is then output to the user and the program ends.

## Time Taken
This program took roughly 30 min to complete

## Technical Advancements Made
This is the first time I have used a dictionary in C#. I was initially going to use 2 arrays that worked in tandom with each other but then I decided to try to learn how dictionaries work. This is why this task took longer than expected. My understanding of dictionaries is still very basic but at least I have learned how to use them in their simplist form.
