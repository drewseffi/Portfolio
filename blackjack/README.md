# Blackjack Project

## Task Aims
The aims of the project are as such:
- Create a virtual deck of cards that include aces and face cards.
- Create a draw card function that will get you a *card* that you will hold in your *hand*.
- Keep a running total of what your score is so far.
- Do this for both the user and the dealer.
- Allow the user to *stand* with the cards that they have
- When user gets a score over 21 they are out.
- If at the end of the game the user has a score higher than the dealer they win and if they have a lower score they lose.
