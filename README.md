# Portfolio

This is a collection of small programs that I have made. These are either programs that I have created from scratch or are from code challenges at https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/.
These are not meant to be large, professional projects. These projects are just me working on my technical skill in small snippets. The idea behind this repository is to track my own personal progress throughout time to see how I have developed as a programmer and to show anyone who is interested some of my skills.
